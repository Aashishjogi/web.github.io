				<h3><b><u>MORE ABOUT ME</b></h3> <pre>
   I have studied about hardware but have always been interested in web development.
   19 years old when I made my first web page with HTML and CSS. 
   While I was studying in the collage I took E.C.E  as my minor subject and was introduced to programming. 
   During my studies I was an active member in student associations and became responsible for all kinds of tasks and projects including being a web master.
   That and my previous interest in web designing.
